 SOC Level 1 Analyst Project – TryHackMe Lab

 Role
SOC Level 1 Analyst (Simulated Environment)

 Responsibilities & Experience
- Performed SOC L1 alert triage by reviewing, prioritizing, and responding to security alerts across multiple severity levels.
- Analyzed alert context and severity to determine True Positive vs False Positive.
- Managed alert lifecycle: assigned alerts, updated investigation status, and documented findings.
- Escalated high-risk and critical alerts to SOC L2 for further investigation.
- Closed low-risk alerts after validation to reduce alert fatigue.
- Documented investigations with clear and structured analyst notes to support workflow and auditing.
